# Expense_Tracker

Expense tracker that tracks and visualizes expenditure. I built this to track my expenses 
after moving to Vancouver from Toronto as I experienced a higher cost of living and 
used this to analyze my spending habits. 

The data you can see is just dummy data that I used to test some functionality.
